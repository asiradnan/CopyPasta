## Why and what
Ever found yourself in a scenario where you have to transfer something (a file or a text) from your phone to the Desktop just in front of you? It’s a very common scenario in our university printing lab though!
If you are not carrying a USB cable, it requires you to connect both devices either by installing a software (takes a lot of time) or you have to login to one of your social media accounts by typing credentials and then maybe completing 2 step verification! If you forget to logout before leaving, it’s very risky in a publicly available computer at your campus or office. Also even if you check all of them it’s a whole lot of work for a simple task right?

To do the simple task in a simple manner, I made this website which is free to use. Simply visit this site from one device and paste the file or text. Visit the site from other device to copy using the key that you have set. You can set the key in a way that it’s easier to remember for you and also harder to guess by anyone else just like your password (in case you don't want anyone else to look into your file or text).

For even a better security, after downloading the file or copying the text you can delete the text and file so that even if one guesses your key, the file and text are no longer there!

You can use the same key again and again by using the edit option. If you upload a new file, it will replace the previous one, or store some new text. This way you don't have to use a new key every time ;)

In short,

1. Paste from one device, copy from another with your self chosen key.

2. Edit or delete text whenever and however you want.
